## cd 
![Image](cdnoarg.png) \
When using cd with no arguments inside lecture1 as our working directory, we seem to move out of the lecture1 directory and back into directory of "~" which is where we find lecture1 in the first place.
This is a functionality of cd, since it is how we are able to go all the way to our home directory if we need to access something else inside of it that isn't in our working directory. This is definitely not an error,
as this is definitely how we are supposed to traverse our filesystem backwards.
